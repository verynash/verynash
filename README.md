- 👋 Hi, I’m @verynash
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, game design, and general software development.
- 🌱 I am pursuing a degree in Software Development at Ivy Tech, after which I intend to transfer to Purdue University to obtain my Bachelor's. I began learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my own through The Odin Project, and have already completed Harvard's CS50x course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything, you only improve by doing. I'd love to get some more experience.
- 📫 Email: sbz.chary@gmail.com
